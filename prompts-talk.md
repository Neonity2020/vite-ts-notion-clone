Based on your requirements, I'll create a beautiful, fully-featured Notion clone with a modern design and comprehensive functionality. This will include block-based editing, drag-and-drop, rich text formatting, and an intuitive interface.

**Core Features**:

- Block-based editor with multiple content types (text, headings, lists, quotes, code)
- Drag and drop functionality for reordering blocks
- Rich text editing with formatting toolbar
- Sidebar navigation with page management
- Search functionality across all content
- Real-time block type switching with "/" commands
- Modern, responsive design with smooth animations
- Local storage for persistence

**Design Elements**:

- Clean, minimalist design inspired by Notion's aesthetic
- Collapsible sidebar with page hierarchy
- Smooth hover states and micro-interactions
- Color system with neutral grays, blue accents, and semantic colors
- Typography hierarchy with proper spacing and contrast
- Responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile
- Subtle shadows and rounded corners for depth
- Consistent 8px spacing system throughout

**Key Features Added:**

1. **Draggable blocks** - Each block can be dragged using the grip handle
2. **Visual feedback** - Blocks become semi-transparent and slightly scaled when dragging
3. **Drop indicators** - Blue lines show where the block will be dropped
4. **Smooth reordering** - Blocks are reordered using the existing `reorderBlocks` function
5. **Custom drag image** - Creates a slightly rotated copy of the block as the drag image

**How it works:**

- Click and drag the grip handle (⋮⋮) to start dragging a block
- A blue line appears to show where the block will be dropped
- Drop the block above or below other blocks to reorder them
- The drag operation is cancelled if dropped in the same position

**Visual enhancements:**

- Dragged blocks become semi-transparent and slightly smaller
- Drop zones are clearly indicated with blue lines
- Smooth transitions for all drag states
- The grip handle cursor changes to indicate draggable state

The implementation uses the HTML5 Drag and Drop API and integrates seamlessly with the existing block management system. Users can now easily reorder their content blocks by dragging them to new positions.
